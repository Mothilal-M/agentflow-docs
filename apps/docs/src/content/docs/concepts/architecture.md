10xGraph is a set of layered packages. Each layer has a single responsibility. You can use just the core Python library, or add the API and client layers when you need to serve agents over HTTP.

## Package layers

```mermaid

  subgraph Client["@10xscale/agentflow-client (TypeScript)"]
    TS[AgentFlowClient]
  end

  subgraph Server["10xscale-agentflow-cli (Python)"]
    CLI[agentflow CLI]
    API[FastAPI server]
    Auth[Auth middleware]
    Routers[REST routers]
  end

  subgraph Core["10xscale-agentflow (Python)"]
    Graph[StateGraph / Agent / ToolNode]
    State[AgentState / Message]
    Prebuilt[ReactAgent / SupervisorTeamAgent / SwarmAgent / prebuilt tools]
    Checkpointer[Checkpointer]
    Store[Memory store]
    Media[Media store]
    Runtime[Runtime / Publisher]
    QA[QA / testing utilities]
  end

### `10xscale-agentflow` — core Python library

| Sub-package | Key exports |
|---|---|
| `agentflow.core` | `StateGraph`, `Agent`, `ToolNode`, `AgentState`, `Message`, `StreamChunk` |
| `agentflow.prebuilt.agent` | `ReactAgent`, `RAGAgent`, `PlanActReflectAgent`, `StructuredOutputAgent`, `SupervisorTeamAgent`, `SwarmAgent`, `AudioAgent` |
| `agentflow.prebuilt.tools` | `safe_calculator`, `fetch_url`, `google_web_search`, `file_read`, `file_write`, `memory_tool`, `create_handoff_tool` |
| `agentflow.storage.checkpointer` | `InMemoryCheckpointer`, `PgCheckpointer` |
| `agentflow.storage.store` | `QdrantStore`, `Mem0Store` |
| `agentflow.storage.media` | `InMemoryMediaStore`, `LocalFileMediaStore`, `CloudMediaStore` |
| `agentflow.runtime` | Publishers (`ConsolePublisher`, `RedisPublisher`, `KafkaPublisher`, `RabbitMQPublisher`, `OtelPublisher`) and LLM SDK converters |
| `agentflow.utils` | `ResponseGranularity`, `CallbackManager`, `tool` decorator |
| `agentflow.qa` | Testing helpers and evaluation tools |

### `10xscale-agentflow-cli` — API and CLI

- **`agentflow api`** — starts a FastAPI server that serves a compiled graph
- **`agentflow play`** — same as `api`, plus opens the hosted playground
- **`agentflow init`** — scaffolds `agentflow.json` and `graph/react.py`
- **`agentflow build`** — generates a Dockerfile and docker-compose
- REST routers for graph invoke, streaming, threads, memory store, and file uploads

### `@10xscale/agentflow-client` — TypeScript HTTP client

Wraps the REST API with typed methods for invoke, stream, threads, and memory.

## Request flow: invoke

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client as TypeScript client
  participant API as FastAPI /v1/graph/invoke
  participant Auth as Auth middleware
  participant Service as GraphService
  participant Graph as Compiled graph
  participant Checkpointer

  Client->>API: POST messages + thread_id
  API->>Auth: verify token
  Auth-->>API: user context
  API->>Service: invoke_graph(input, user)
  Service->>Checkpointer: load state for thread_id
  Checkpointer-->>Service: AgentState
  Service->>Graph: app.invoke(state)
  Graph-->>Service: updated AgentState
  Service->>Checkpointer: save state for thread_id
  Service-->>API: messages
  API-->>Client: JSON response
```

## Request flow: stream

The stream flow is identical through authentication and state loading. The difference is the graph sends `StreamChunk` events incrementally using server-sent events (SSE), and the response is a `StreamingResponse`. Each `StreamChunk` carries an `event` field (`"message"`, `"state"`, `"error"`, or `"updates"`).

---

## Key design decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Graph compiled once at startup | Avoids repeated module loading per request |
| `thread_id` in every request | Allows stateless servers to restore conversation history |
| Checkpointer is injected, not hardcoded | Graph code does not depend on the storage backend |
| Auth is middleware, not in the graph | Business logic stays separate from access control |
| `injectq` for service wiring | Nodes and tools declare dependencies declaratively; the runtime resolves them |
