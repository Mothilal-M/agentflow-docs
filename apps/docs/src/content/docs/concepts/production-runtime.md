Running `app.invoke` in a script is fine for experimentation. Production deployments require an HTTP server, async execution, state persistence, and the ability to handle concurrent requests.

## How the API server works

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph Process["agentflow api process"]
    Uvicorn[Uvicorn ASGI server]
    FastAPI[FastAPI app]
    Auth[Auth middleware]
    GraphService[GraphService]
    CompiledGraph[Compiled graph\nloaded once at startup]
    Checkpointer[Checkpointer]
    Store[Memory store]
  end

  Request[HTTP request] --> Uvicorn
  Uvicorn --> FastAPI
  FastAPI --> Auth
  Auth --> GraphService
  GraphService --> CompiledGraph
  CompiledGraph --> Checkpointer
  CompiledGraph --> Store
```

The CLI starts a Uvicorn ASGI server. The FastAPI app loads your compiled graph **once** at startup and reuses it for every request. This avoids module loading overhead per request.

## Async execution

The `GraphService` runs your graph in a thread pool so that blocking model calls do not delay the event loop. You do not need to write `async` code in your graph nodes — the runtime handles scheduling.

If your graph nodes are already `async` functions, the runtime awaits them directly.

## Publisher adapters

The `agentflow.runtime.publisher` module provides adapters for different streaming transports. Internally the API uses the SSE publisher to send `StreamChunk` events over `POST /v1/graph/stream`.

You do not interact with publisher adapters directly unless you are embedding the graph outside the standard API server.

## Multi-worker deployment

For production scale, run multiple worker processes behind a load balancer. Because state is stored in the checkpointer (and optionally in the memory store), any worker can handle any request as long as they share the same storage backend.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  LB[Load balancer] --> W1[Worker 1\nagentflow api]
  LB --> W2[Worker 2\nagentflow api]
  LB --> W3[Worker 3\nagentflow api]
  W1 & W2 & W3 --> PG[(PostgreSQL\ncheckpointer)]
  W1 & W2 & W3 --> Qdrant[(Qdrant\nmemory store)]
```

Use `PgCheckpointer` (backed by Postgres + Redis) so that state is shared across workers. `InMemoryCheckpointer` is process-local and breaks in a multi-worker setup.

## Environment configuration

The API server reads settings from environment variables. Key variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MODE` | `development` or `production` | `development` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging verbosity | `INFO` |
| `ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed CORS origins | `*` |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Secret key for JWT auth | — |
| `JWT_ALGORITHM` | JWT signing algorithm | `HS256` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis URL for `PgCheckpointer` | — |

In production, set `MODE=production`. This enables stricter security header checks and logs warnings for unsafe defaults like `ORIGINS=*`.

## Docker deployment

Generate a Dockerfile:

```bash
agentflow build --docker-compose
```

This creates a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` configured for the standard API server. See [Generate Docker files](/docs/how-to/api-cli/generate-docker-files) for options.

## What you learned

- The API server loads the compiled graph once at startup.
- Async scheduling is handled by the runtime — your nodes can be sync or async.
- Multi-worker deployments require `PgCheckpointer` for shared state.
- Set `MODE=production` and configure `ORIGINS` for secure production deployments.
