`GET /v1/observability/{thread_id}` reconstructs a run trace for a thread from the events its runs emitted: a span tree, a flat event list, aggregated token usage, and call counts. It is what the playground's trace view renders.

Base path: `/v1/observability`

Permission: `graph:read`.

### Top level

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `thread_id` | string | The thread that was queried |
| `run_count` | integer | Number of runs recorded for the thread |
| `run_ids` | string array | Every recorded run id, so a client can offer a run picker |
| `run` | object or `null` | The requested (or latest) run. `null` when the thread has no recorded runs. |

### Run

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run_id` | string | Run identifier |
| `thread_id` | string | Owning thread |
| `status` | string | `running`, `done`, `error`, or `stopped` |
| `started_at` | number or `null` | Unix timestamp (seconds, fractional) |
| `finished_at` | number or `null` | Unix timestamp (seconds, fractional) |
| `duration_ms` | number | Wall-clock run duration in milliseconds |
| `spans` | array | The span tree, see below |
| `events` | array | Flat event list, see below |
| `usage` | object | Aggregated token usage |
| `llm_calls` | integer | Number of records that carried token usage |
| `tool_calls` | integer | Number of tool calls observed in the records |
| `iterations` | integer | Number of distinct nodes the run touched |

### Span

Spans form a tree rooted at a single `root` span covering the whole run. Node spans hang off the root; LLM and tool spans hang off the node span they occurred under, falling back to `root` when the node is unknown.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Span id, stable within the run. The root span is always `root`; the rest are `s1`, `s2`, and so on in emission order. |
| `name` | string | `graph` for the root, `node: <node>` for node spans, `llm.generate` for LLM spans, `tool: <tool_name>` for tool spans |
| `kind` | string | `root`, `node`, `llm`, or `tool` |
| `parent` | string or `null` | Parent span id. `null` for the root span. |
| `start_ms` | number | Offset from the run start, in milliseconds |
| `duration_ms` | number | Span duration in milliseconds. LLM and tool spans are point-in-time markers and report `0.0`; only root and node spans carry a real duration. |
| `model` | string or `null` | Model name. Present on `llm` spans. |
| `input_tokens` | integer or `null` | Prompt tokens. Present on `llm` spans. |
| `output_tokens` | integer or `null` | Completion tokens. Present on `llm` spans. |

### Event

Events are returned **newest first**, so a UI can render the list without reversing it. Ids are assigned in chronological order (`e0` is the oldest), which means the ids count down through the array.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Event id, `e<index>` in chronological order |
| `type` | string | `message`, `updates`, `state`, `error`, or `result` |
| `node` | string | Node the event is attributed to. Empty when not node-scoped. |
| `offset_ms` | number | Offset from the run start, in milliseconds |
| `summary` | string | One-line summary, for example `tool_call get_weather`, `llm.generate · 955 tokens`, `error`, or `delta` |

### Token usage

| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `prompt_tokens` | integer |
| `completion_tokens` | integer |
| `reasoning_tokens` | integer |
| `total_tokens` | integer |

## Availability

Traces come from an in-process telemetry store that records chunks as runs execute. It is bound **only outside production**: when `MODE=production` the store is not created and this endpoint returns an empty payload (`run_count: 0`, `run: null`) rather than an error.

The store is in-memory and not durable. It is a development and playground aid, not a production observability system. For production tracing, configure OpenTelemetry (`OTEL_ENABLED`) or the `observability` block in `agentflow.json`.

Both `POST /v1/graph/invoke` and `POST /v1/graph/stream` record runs. Invoke has no chunk stream, so its trace is reconstructed from the final messages, which is enough for usage and cost but produces a coarser span tree than a streamed run.
