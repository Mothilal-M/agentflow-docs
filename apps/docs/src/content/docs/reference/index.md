Four surfaces, one system. Pick the one you are calling from.

## Python library

The graph engine, agents, tools, state, storage, and the evaluation harness.
Everything importable from `agentflow.*`.

| Start with | For |
| --- | --- |
| [Graph](/docs/reference/python/graph) | `StateGraph`, `CompiledGraph`, `START`, `END`, `invoke`, `stream` |
| [Agent](/docs/reference/python/agent) | `Agent`, `ToolNode`, and how a model is wired into a node |
| [State](/docs/reference/python/state) and [Messages](/docs/reference/python/messages) | `AgentState`, `Message`, content blocks |
| [Tools](/docs/reference/python/tools) | The `@tool` decorator and tool signatures |
| [Checkpointers](/docs/reference/python/checkpointers) | `InMemoryCheckpointer`, `PgCheckpointer`, durability |
| [Memory stores](/docs/reference/python/memory-stores) | Cross-thread memory and vector backends |
| [Evaluation](/docs/reference/python/evaluation) | `EvalSet`, `EvalCase`, and how a run is scored |

## REST and WebSocket API

What the API server exposes once you run `agentflow api`.

The server generates its own OpenAPI schema, so the authoritative contract for
*your* build is always available locally:

| Surface | Default path | Setting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Swagger UI | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` | `DOCS_PATH` |
| ReDoc | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redocs` | `REDOCS_PATH` |
| OpenAPI JSON | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json` | FastAPI default, always on |

Set `DOCS_PATH` and `REDOCS_PATH` to empty values in production to turn the
interactive docs off; the server warns if they are left on. Note that the raw
schema at `/openapi.json` stays available regardless, so block it at the proxy
if you do not want it public.

| Group | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Graph](/docs/reference/rest-api/graph) | Invoke and stream a compiled graph |
| [Live WebSocket](/docs/reference/rest-api/live) | Bidirectional runs and realtime audio |
| [Threads](/docs/reference/rest-api/threads) | Conversation history and thread management |
| [Memory store](/docs/reference/rest-api/memory-store) | Store, search, list, forget |
| [Files](/docs/reference/rest-api/files) | Upload and retrieval |
| [Observability](/docs/reference/rest-api/observability) | Run inspection |
| [Evals](/docs/reference/rest-api/evals) | Running evaluations over HTTP |
| [Ping](/docs/reference/rest-api/ping) | Health check used by probes |

## CLI and configuration

| Page | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Commands](/docs/reference/api-cli/commands) | `init`, `api`, `play`, `build`, `eval`, `test`, `skills`, `version` |
| [Configuration](/docs/reference/api-cli/configuration) | Every `agentflow.json` key |
| [Environment](/docs/reference/api-cli/environment) | Every environment variable |
| [Auth](/docs/reference/api-cli/auth) | JWT and custom `BaseAuth` |
| [Rate limiting](/docs/reference/api-cli/rate-limiting) | Backends and limits |

## TypeScript client

`@10xscale/agentflow-client`, framework-agnostic and fully typed.

| Page | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [AgentFlowClient](/docs/reference/client/agentflow-client) | Construction and shared options |
| [Invoke](/docs/reference/client/invoke) and [Stream](/docs/reference/client/stream) | Running an agent |
| [Realtime](/docs/reference/client/realtime) | Audio sessions |
| [Threads](/docs/reference/client/threads), [Memory](/docs/reference/client/memory), [Files](/docs/reference/client/files) | Everything else the server exposes |

## Conventions used here

- Signatures are the real ones. If a page and the source disagree, the source is
  right and the page is a bug: please [report it](/docs/project/support).
- Async methods are marked. Most Python entry points have both an `async`
  version and a sync wrapper, and the reference names both.
- Defaults are stated explicitly, including when the default is `None`.
- Error codes are listed with the condition that raises them. The full index is
  in [error codes](/docs/troubleshooting/error-codes).

Reference pages describe what things *are*. For task-shaped questions, start from
the [how-to guides](/docs/how-to/python/build-a-graph).
