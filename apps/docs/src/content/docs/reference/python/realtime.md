The realtime subsystem provides live, audio-to-audio sessions backed by Gemini Live. It is a separate runtime from the turn-based `invoke`/`stream` path: the provider owns the turn loop, and 10xGraph wraps it with a duplex pump, tool dispatch, transcript persistence, and automatic reconnection.

## Install extra

```bash
pip install "10xscale-agentflow[realtime]"
```

Provider SDK imports are lazy. Importing `agentflow.core.realtime` does not load `google-genai` until a session opens.

## Import paths

```python
# Public API surface
from agentflow.core.realtime import (
    # Input queue
    LiveInputQueue, LiveInput, LiveInputKind,
    # Config types
    RealtimeConfig, VADConfig, ReconnectConfig,
    # Event union and all event classes
    RealtimeEvent,
    AudioDeltaEvent, InputTranscriptEvent, OutputTranscriptEvent,
    ToolCallEvent, ToolResultEvent, TurnCompleteEvent, InterruptedEvent,
    SessionUpdateEvent, GoAwayEvent, AgentChangedEvent, ErrorEvent,
    # Provider client (Gemini)
    RealtimeClient, GeminiLiveClient, normalize_message,
)

# Prebuilt agent
from agentflow.prebuilt.agent import AudioAgent

# Audio format constants
from agentflow.core.realtime.base import INPUT_SAMPLE_RATE, OUTPUT_SAMPLE_RATE
```

`INPUT_SAMPLE_RATE = 16000` (Hz); `OUTPUT_SAMPLE_RATE = 24000` (Hz).

---

## AudioAgent

Prebuilt realtime agent builder. Mirrors `ReactAgent`'s construction surface and wraps a `LiveAgent` as the graph root. Compile it once and drive sessions with `CompiledGraph.arealtime()`.

```python
from agentflow.prebuilt.agent import AudioAgent
```

### Constructor

```python
AudioAgent(
    model: str,
    state: StateT | None = None,
    context_manager: BaseContextManager | None = None,
    publisher: BasePublisher | list[BasePublisher] | None = None,
    id_generator: BaseIDGenerator = DefaultIDGenerator(),
    container: Any | None = None,
    *,
    realtime_config: RealtimeConfig | None = None,
    system_prompt: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None,
    tools: Iterable[Callable] | None = None,
    client: Any = None,                        # MCP client
    pass_user_info_to_mcp: bool = False,
    skills: SkillConfig | None = None,
    memory: MemoryConfig | None = None,
    realtime_client_factory: Callable[[], RealtimeClient] | None = None,
    live_node_name: str = "LIVE",
    **agent_kwargs,
)
```

| Parameter | Notes |
|---|---|
| `model` | Model string resolved through `detect_provider`. Must resolve to `"google"` provider; only Gemini Live is supported in v1. |
| `state` | Initial `AgentState` subclass instance for the graph. |
| `context_manager` | `BaseContextManager` applied to the conversation context. |
| `publisher` | One publisher or a list of them, forwarded to the underlying `StateGraph`. |
| `id_generator` | ID generator for thread, run, and message IDs. Defaults to `DefaultIDGenerator()`. |
| `container` | An existing InjectQ container to build the graph against. When omitted, the ambient container is used. Pass one to isolate DI bindings per agent, which matters when several agents run in the same process. |
| `realtime_config` | Per-session config. Defaults to `RealtimeConfig(model=model)` if omitted. |
| `system_prompt` | List of `{"role": "system", "content": "..."}` dicts. Flattened into `system_instruction` at connect time. |
| `tools` | Callable tools passed to a `ToolNode`. Advertised to the provider at connect time. |
| `client` | MCP client (fastmcp / mcp). |
| `pass_user_info_to_mcp` | Forward the run's user identity to MCP tool calls. Forwarded to the internal `ToolNode`. Defaults to `False`. |
| `skills` | `SkillConfig` for dynamic skill injection. |
| `memory` | `MemoryConfig` for long-term memory. |
| `realtime_client_factory` | Zero-argument callable returning a `RealtimeClient`. Overrides the default provider client factory: use it to inject a fake client in tests, or to supply a pre-authenticated Gemini Live client. |
| `live_node_name` | Name of the graph node holding the `LiveAgent`. Defaults to `"LIVE"`. Change it when the name collides with another node or when a lifecycle hook keys off node names. |
| `**agent_kwargs` | Forwarded verbatim to the underlying `LiveAgent`. |

A `ToolNode` is only created when `tools` or `client` is provided; otherwise the live agent runs without tools.

### compile()

```python
app = AudioAgent(...).compile(
    checkpointer: BaseCheckpointer | None = None,
    store: BaseStore | None = None,
    callback_manager: CallbackManager | None = None,
    shutdown_timeout: float = 30.0,
) -> CompiledGraph
```

`compile()` does not accept `media_store`, `interrupt_before`, or `interrupt_after`. Realtime media is sent frame-by-frame through `LiveInputQueue` and is never offloaded.

---

## CompiledGraph.arealtime / realtime

```python
async def arealtime(
    input_queue: LiveInputQueue,
    config: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    state: AgentState | None = None,
) -> AsyncIterator[RealtimeEvent]

def realtime(
    input_queue: LiveInputQueue,
    config: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    state: AgentState | None = None,
) -> Generator[RealtimeEvent]
```

`arealtime` is an async generator; use it from async contexts. `realtime` is a synchronous wrapper that drives a private event loop and raises if called from inside a running event loop.

**Config keys:**

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `thread_id` | Thread for this session. Required for persistence and resume. |
| `user_id` | User identifier. Forwarded to tools via injectable params. |
| `realtime` | Dict of `RealtimeConfig` field overrides for this session only. |

**Forcing rules:**

- A graph containing a `LiveAgent` must use `arealtime()` / `realtime()`. Calling `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, or `astream` raises `RuntimeError`.
- `arealtime()` requires exactly one `LiveAgent` in the graph. Zero or more than one raises.
- `realtime()` raises if called from a thread with a running event loop.

---

## LiveInputQueue

Non-blocking upstream input queue. Feed it from any context including audio capture callbacks on other threads.

```python
LiveInputQueue(maxsize: int = 0)
```

All send methods are synchronous (`put_nowait`), so the input side keeps accepting audio while the model is still generating. That is the precondition for barge-in. Feed one queue per session.

`maxsize=0` (the default) means unbounded. With a positive `maxsize`, a frame that arrives when the queue is full is dropped and logged at warning level rather than blocking the producer. Sends after `close()` are dropped silently (logged at DEBUG).

### Methods

| Method | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `send_audio` | `(data: bytes, sample_rate: int = 16000) -> None` | Send a chunk of PCM16 audio. |
| `send_text` | `(text: str) -> None` | Inject a text turn into the live session. |
| `send_image` | `(data: bytes, mime_type: str = "image/jpeg") -> None` | Send a still image or a single video frame. |
| `send_activity_start` | `() -> None` | Manual VAD: mark start of user speech. Only meaningful when `vad.enabled=False`. |
| `send_activity_end` | `() -> None` | Manual VAD: mark end of user speech. Pairs with `send_activity_start`; the provider treats the enclosed audio as one user turn and begins responding. |
| `close` | `() -> None` | Signal end of input. Idempotent: repeated calls do nothing. Enqueues a single `close` sentinel, which ends the `async for` loop over the queue and lets the pump task finish. Later sends are dropped. |

`closed` is a read-only property reporting whether `close()` has been called.

#### Image input

`send_image` is a Python-SDK capability. Gemini Live accepts still images and video as individual frames, so send video as a stream of frames; roughly 1 fps is the model's effective ceiling. `mime_type` must be an image type the provider supports and defaults to `image/jpeg`.

```python
queue.send_image(jpeg_bytes, mime_type="image/jpeg")
```

The API server's `/v1/graph/live` WebSocket bridge forwards audio and text only, so image input is not available over that socket. Use the SDK path when you need it.

### LiveInput

The dataclass frames enqueued by `send_*`. Not normally constructed directly.

```python
@dataclass
class LiveInput:
    kind: LiveInputKind   # "audio" | "text" | "image" | "activity_start" | "activity_end" | "close"
    data: bytes | None = None
    text: str | None = None
    sample_rate: int = 16000
    mime_type: str | None = None
```

---

## RealtimeConfig

Per-session configuration for a realtime session.

```python
from agentflow.core.realtime import RealtimeConfig
```

```python
RealtimeConfig(
    model: str,
    response_modalities: list[Literal["AUDIO", "TEXT"]] = ["AUDIO"],
    voice: str | None = None,
    system_instruction: str | None = None,
    input_audio_transcription: bool = True,
    output_audio_transcription: bool = True,
    vad: VADConfig = VADConfig(),
    reconnect: ReconnectConfig = ReconnectConfig(),
    context_window_compression: bool = False,
    session_resumption: bool = True,
    tools: list[Any] | None = None,
    tools_tags: list[str] | None = None,
)
```

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | required | Gemini Live model string. |
| `response_modalities` | `["AUDIO"]` | Exactly one modality per session (validated). Pass `["TEXT"]` for a text-only session. |
| `voice` | `None` | Provider voice name (e.g. `"Puck"`). Provider default when `None`. |
| `system_instruction` | `None` | Fixed at connect time for the lifetime of the session. When `AudioAgent.system_prompt` is set, it overrides this field at connect time. |
| `input_audio_transcription` | `True` | Enable provider-side transcription of user speech. |
| `output_audio_transcription` | `True` | Enable provider-side transcription of model speech. |
| `vad` | `VADConfig()` | Voice-activity detection settings. |
| `reconnect` | `ReconnectConfig()` | Reconnect/backoff policy. |
| `context_window_compression` | `False` | Enable provider-side context window compression. |
| `session_resumption` | `True` | Store and use Gemini session resumption handles. Requires a checkpointer for cross-session resume. |
| `tools` | `None` | Override the auto-derived tool schemas. When `None`, schemas are taken from the `ToolNode`. |
| `tools_tags` | `None` | Filter which tools are advertised by tag. |

`response_modalities` is validated: it must contain exactly one entry. Passing `["AUDIO", "TEXT"]` raises `ValueError`.

---

## VADConfig

Voice-activity detection settings. Disable for push-to-talk (manual activity) workflows.

```python
from agentflow.core.realtime import VADConfig

VADConfig(
    enabled: bool = True,
    start_sensitivity: str | None = None,
    end_sensitivity: str | None = None,
    prefix_padding_ms: int | None = None,
    silence_duration_ms: int | None = None,
)
```

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `True` | Set `False` to use manual push-to-talk via `send_activity_start` / `send_activity_end`. |
| `start_sensitivity` | `None` | Provider-neutral sensitivity hint. `None` uses provider default. |
| `end_sensitivity` | `None` | Provider-neutral sensitivity hint. `None` uses provider default. |
| `prefix_padding_ms` | `None` | Audio prepended before detected speech onset. |
| `silence_duration_ms` | `None` | Silence duration that triggers end-of-speech detection. |

---

## ReconnectConfig

Reconnect and backoff policy for dropped sessions.

```python
from agentflow.core.realtime import ReconnectConfig

ReconnectConfig(
    base_delay: float = 0.5,
    max_delay: float = 10.0,
    max_attempts: int = 5,
)
```

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `base_delay` | `0.5` | Base delay in seconds for exponential backoff. |
| `max_delay` | `10.0` | Maximum delay cap in seconds. |
| `max_attempts` | `5` | Maximum error-driven reconnect attempts. Set `0` to disable error-driven reconnect entirely. |

**Reconnect rules:**

- `go_away` (planned provider rotation): reconnect immediately with no backoff, attempts counter is not incremented.
- Transient drop / receive error: attempt `n` waits `min(base_delay * 2^(n-1), max_delay)` seconds, up to `max_attempts`. After the cap, a fatal `ErrorEvent(code="reconnect_failed")` is emitted and the session ends.
- Any successful receive resets the attempts counter to 0.

---

## RealtimeEvent

Discriminated union keyed on `type`. All events are Pydantic models.

```python
from agentflow.core.realtime import RealtimeEvent
```

### AudioDeltaEvent

```python
type: Literal["audio_delta"]
data: bytes        # PCM16 chunk at OUTPUT_SAMPLE_RATE (24000 Hz)
sample_rate: int   # always 24000
```

A chunk of model audio output. Write it to a speaker or file.

### InputTranscriptEvent

```python
type: Literal["input_transcript"]
text: str
finished: bool     # True on the final chunk; text carries the complete transcript
```

Transcript of the user's speech. The provider streams partial chunks (`finished=False`) as they are transcribed. On `finished=True`, `text` carries the complete transcript for the turn. Persisted to the checkpointer thread when finished.

### OutputTranscriptEvent

```python
type: Literal["output_transcript"]
text: str
finished: bool
```

Transcript of the model's speech. Same streaming/finished semantics as `InputTranscriptEvent`. Persisted to the checkpointer thread when finished.

### ToolCallEvent

```python
type: Literal["tool_call"]
id: str
name: str
args: dict[str, Any]
```

The provider is requesting a tool invocation. 10xGraph dispatches this automatically through the `ToolNode` and returns the result before the model continues. Emitted before tool execution for observability.

### ToolResultEvent

```python
type: Literal["tool_result"]
id: str
result: Any
```

Emitted after a tool finishes, for observability. The result has already been sent back to the model.

### TurnCompleteEvent

```python
type: Literal["turn_complete"]
```

The model finished generating a turn (audio and transcription complete).

### InterruptedEvent

```python
type: Literal["interrupted"]
```

Barge-in: the user spoke while the model was talking. Flush any queued audio playback. Partial transcripts for the interrupted turn are discarded.

### SessionUpdateEvent

```python
type: Literal["session_update"]
resumption_handle: str | None
```

The provider issued a session-resumption handle. Stored in the checkpointer thread metadata automatically when a checkpointer is provided.

### GoAwayEvent

```python
type: Literal["go_away"]
time_left: str | None    # provider duration string (e.g. "5s"); verbatim
```

The provider will close the socket soon (planned rotation). The runtime reconnects immediately with the cached resumption handle; no intervention is required from the caller.

### AgentChangedEvent

```python
type: Literal["agent_changed"]
author: str
```

The active agent or persona changed. Reserved for future multi-agent persona swap.

### ErrorEvent

```python
type: Literal["error"]
code: str | None
message: str
fatal: bool
```

A normalized provider error. Non-fatal errors are transient; the session continues. Fatal errors (`fatal=True`) end the session; `code="reconnect_failed"` means reconnect attempts were exhausted.

---

## RealtimeClient (Protocol)

Provider-neutral protocol that all provider clients implement. Not used directly in application code; use `AudioAgent` instead.

```python
from agentflow.core.realtime import RealtimeClient
```

| Method | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `connect` | `async (config: RealtimeConfig, resume_handle: str \| None = None) -> None` | Open a provider socket. |
| `send_audio` | `async (pcm: bytes, sample_rate: int) -> None` | Send PCM16 audio input. |
| `send_text` | `async (text: str) -> None` | Send a text turn. |
| `send_image` | `async (data: bytes, mime_type: str) -> None` | Send an image frame. |
| `send_activity_start` | `async () -> None` | Manual VAD: start marker. |
| `send_activity_end` | `async () -> None` | Manual VAD: end marker. |
| `send_tool_response` | `async (call_id: str, name: str, result: Any) -> None` | Return a tool result to the model. |
| `reseed_history` | `async (messages: list[Any]) -> None` | Seed conversation history into a fresh session. |
| `receive` | `() -> AsyncIterator[RealtimeEvent]` | Yield normalized events from the provider. |
| `close` | `async () -> None` | Close the socket. Safe to call more than once. |

### GeminiLiveClient

The Gemini Live provider client. Import path: `agentflow.core.realtime.GeminiLiveClient`. Used by `LiveAgent` internally; inject a custom factory via `AudioAgent(realtime_client_factory=...)` for testing.

```python
from agentflow.core.realtime import GeminiLiveClient, normalize_message
```

`normalize_message` converts Gemini wire messages to `RealtimeEvent` objects.

---

## GraphLifecycleHook integration

Realtime sessions fire lifecycle hooks via `GraphLifecycleHook`. Register via `CallbackManager.register_lifecycle_hook` and pass `callback_manager` to `compile()`.

```python
from agentflow.utils.callbacks import CallbackManager, GraphLifecycleHook
from agentflow.core.state import AgentState

class SessionAuditHook(GraphLifecycleHook):
    async def on_graph_start(self, ctx, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        print("session started")
        return state

    async def on_graph_end(self, ctx, state, messages, total_steps: int) -> None:
        print(f"session ended after {total_steps} turns")

    async def on_turn_start(self, ctx, state: AgentState, turn_index: int) -> AgentState:
        print(f"turn {turn_index} starting")
        return state

    async def on_turn_end(self, ctx, state: AgentState, turn_index: int) -> AgentState:
        print(f"turn {turn_index} complete")
        return state

cb = CallbackManager()
cb.register_lifecycle_hook(SessionAuditHook())

app = AudioAgent(MODEL, ...).compile(callback_manager=cb)
```

Hook semantics in realtime:

| Hook | When | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `on_graph_start` | Once, before the first turn | The session opened. |
| `on_graph_end` | Once, after the session closes | `total_steps` = number of turns completed. |
| `on_turn_start` | Before each model generation turn | `turn_index` is 1-based. |
| `on_turn_end` | After `turn_complete` or `interrupted` | If the session closes mid-turn (no `turn_complete`), still fired. |

These hooks are no-ops for `invoke` and `stream`. Tool/MCP before/after/error callbacks fire as usual. No AI-invocation callback or input-validator pass runs in realtime.

---

## API server WebSocket bridge

`agentflow api` exposes `ws://<host>/v1/graph/live` when the configured graph contains a `LiveAgent`.

### Protocol reference

**Auth:** `RequirePermission("graph", "stream")`. Browser WebSocket clients can pass the token as a `?token=` query parameter.

**Frame 1 (client -> server): JSON control (init)**

```json
{
  "thread_id": "abc",
  "model": "gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview",
  "voice": "Puck",
  "modalities": ["AUDIO"],
  "vad": {"enabled": true}
}
```

All fields are optional. Present fields override the agent's build-time `RealtimeConfig` for this session. A new `thread_id` is generated if absent.

**Subsequent upstream frames:**

| Frame type | Content |
|---|---|
| Binary | PCM16 input audio at 16 kHz |
| JSON text `{"type": "text", "text": "..."}` | Inject a text turn |
| JSON text `{"type": "activity_start"}` | Manual VAD start |
| JSON text `{"type": "activity_end"}` | Manual VAD end |
| JSON text `{"type": "close"}` | End the session |

**Downstream frames:**

| Frame type | Content |
|---|---|
| Binary | PCM16 model audio at 24 kHz (`audio_delta`) |
| JSON text | All other `RealtimeEvent` objects serialized via `model_dump(mode="json")` |

Image/video input is SDK-only. The WebSocket bridge does not forward image frames.

### WebSocket close codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `1003` | Invalid init frame (not JSON, not a dict). |
| `1011` | Internal server error (e.g. non-live graph, provider/checkpointer error). |
| `1000` | Normal close (session ended). |

---

## Common errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ImportError: google.generativeai` | Session opened without the `realtime` extra installed. | `pip install "10xscale-agentflow[realtime]"`. |
| `ValueError: LiveAgent v1 supports only Gemini Live (google provider)` | Model string resolved to a non-Google provider. | Use a `gemini-*` model string or prefix with `gemini/`. |
| `RuntimeError: This graph contains a LiveAgent; use .arealtime()` | Called `invoke`/`stream` on a realtime graph. | Switch to `arealtime()`. |
| `RuntimeError: arealtime() requires a graph rooted at a LiveAgent` | Called `arealtime()` on a non-realtime graph. | Use `AudioAgent` or add a `LiveAgent` node. |
| `RuntimeError: realtime() (sync) cannot be called from a running event loop` | Called `realtime()` inside an async context. | Use `await arealtime()` instead. |
| `ValueError: response_modalities must contain exactly one modality` | Passed two modalities to `RealtimeConfig`. | Pass exactly one: `["AUDIO"]` or `["TEXT"]`. |
| `ErrorEvent(code="reconnect_failed", fatal=True)` | Reconnect attempts exhausted after transient drops. | Check network stability; increase `max_attempts` or `max_delay`. |
