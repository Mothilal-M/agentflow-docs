## Concept: The LLM App Lifecycle

Before diving into specific problems, understand the typical lifecycle of a GenAI application:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Lifecycle["LLM App Lifecycle"]
        subgraph Phase1["1. Discovery"]
            D1["Identify use case"]
            D2["Assess fit"]
            D3["Define requirements"]
        end
        
        subgraph Phase2["2. Design"]
            D4["Design prompt"]
            D5["Choose model"]
            D6["Plan architecture"]
        end
        
        subgraph Phase3["3. Build"]
            D7["Implement agent"]
            D8["Add tools"]
            D9["Handle state"]
        end
        
        subgraph Phase4["4. Evaluate"]
            D10["Build tests"]
            D11["Measure quality"]
            D12["Iterate"]
        end
        
        subgraph Phase5["5. Deploy"]
            D13["Add safety"]
            D14["Monitor"]
            D15["Maintain"]
        end
    end
    
    Phase1 --> Phase2 --> Phase3 --> Phase4 --> Phase5
```

This lesson focuses on **Phase 1 and 2**—understanding when and how to use GenAI.

## Concept: What Problems Fit GenAI?

Not every problem needs an LLM. Understanding fit is the first skill for building GenAI systems.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Fit["Problem Fit Spectrum"]
        subgraph Simple["No LLM"]
            N1["Deterministic calculations"]
            N2["Fixed rules"]
            N3["Database queries"]
        end
        
        subgraph LLMApps["LLM Application"]
            L1["Classification"]
            L2["Generation"]
            L3["Extraction"]
            L4["Summarization"]
        end
        
        subgraph Workflows["Workflow + LLM"]
            W1["Sequential steps"]
            W2["LLM for specific steps"]
            W3["Human approval gates"]
        end
        
        subgraph Agents["Agentic System"]
            A1["Dynamic tool use"]
            A2["Variable paths"]
            A3["Multi-turn reasoning"]
        end
    end

### Decision Tree: Do You Need an LLM?

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Start["What's your problem?"]
    
    Start --> Q1["Is the task deterministic?"]
    Q1 --> |"Yes, always same output"| NoLLM["No LLM needed\nUse traditional software"]
    Q1 --> |"No, varies based on input"| Q2
    
    Q2["Does it need natural language?"]
    Q2 --> |"No"| MaybeLLM["Maybe LLM\n(depends on complexity)"]
    Q2 --> |"Yes, understanding or generation"| Q3
    
    Q3["Does it need external data/actions?"]
    Q3 --> |"No"| LLMApp["LLM Application"]
    Q3 --> |"Yes"| Q4
    
    Q4["Are steps known in advance?"]
    Q4 --> |"Yes, sequential"| Workflow["Workflow + LLM"]
    Q4 --> |"No, dynamic paths"| Agent["Agent"]
    
    style NoLLM fill:#ccffcc
    style LLMApp fill:#ffffcc
    style Workflow fill:#ffcc99
    style Agent fill:#ffcccc
```

### When to Use (and Not Use) LLMs

| Use LLM When | Don't Use LLM When |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Natural language understanding needed | Precise calculations required |
| Flexible output format acceptable | Exact, deterministic output needed |
| Knowledge is broad or dynamic | Knowledge is fixed and small |
| Content generation required | Data transformation (use ETL) |
| Classification with context | Binary true/false logic |
| Summarization of text | Copying data between systems |

## Concept: Core Building Blocks

Every GenAI application has the same fundamental building blocks:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Blocks["Core Building Blocks"]
        Model["Model\n(LLM provider)"]
        Instructions["Instructions\n(System + user prompts)"]
        Tools["Tools\n(External capabilities)"]
        State["State\n(Conversation + memory)"]
        Output["Output\n(Structured or freeform)"]
    end
    
    subgraph AppLayer["GenAI Application"]
        P[Prompt Template]
        I[Instructions]
        T[Tools]
        S[State/Memory]
    end
    
    Model --> |"token prediction"| Output
    Instructions --> |"guidance"| Model
    Tools --> |"extends capabilities"| Model
    State --> |"context"| Model
    
    P & I & T & S --> Model
```

| Block | What It Is | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Model** | The LLM that generates responses | GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini |
| **Instructions** | Prompts that guide behavior | System instructions, user messages |
| **Tools** | Functions the model can call | Calculator, search, database |
| **State** | What the system remembers | Conversation history, variables |
| **Output** | The response format | JSON, text, streaming tokens |

## Concept: Model Selection Deep Dive

Model choice is an engineering decision. Consider these factors:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Factors["Model Selection Factors"]
        subgraph Requirements["Must Have"]
            R1["Capability: vision, tools, etc."]
            R2["Context window size"]
            R3["Cost constraints"]
        end
        
        subgraph NiceToHave["Nice to Have"]
            N1["Latency requirements"]
            N2["Quality requirements"]
            N3["Reasoning depth"]
        end
    end
```

### Provider Comparison

| Provider | Model | Context | Strengths | Best For |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o | 128K | Balanced, tool use | General purpose |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o Mini | 128K | Fast, cheap | High volume |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 200K | Long context, reasoning | Complex tasks |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3 Haiku | 200K | Fast, affordable | Speed-sensitive |
| **Google** | Gemini 1.5 Pro | 1M | Massive context | Long documents |

### Model Selection Decision Matrix

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Decision["Model Selection Decision"]
        Q1["What's your primary constraint?"]
        
        Q1 --> |"Cost"| C1["GPT-4o Mini\nClaude Haiku\nGemini Flash"]
        Q1 --> |"Quality"| C2["GPT-4o\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\nGemini Pro"]
        Q1 --> |"Speed"| C3["Claude Haiku\nGPT-4o Mini\nGemini Flash"]
        Q1 --> |"Context"| C4["Claude 3.5\nGemini 1.5\nGPT-4 Turbo"]
    end
```

### Cost Estimation

```python
def estimate_monthly_cost(
    daily_requests: int,
    avg_input_tokens: int,
    avg_output_tokens: int,
    model: str = "gpt-4o"
) -> float:
    """Estimate monthly API costs."""
    
    costs = {
        "gpt-4o": {"input": 5.00, "output": 15.00},  # per 1M tokens
        "gpt-4o-mini": {"input": 0.15, "output": 0.60},
        "claude-3-5-sonnet": {"input": 3.00, "output": 15.00},
    }
    
    model_costs = costs.get(model, costs["gpt-4o"])
    
    daily_input_cost = (daily_requests * avg_input_tokens / 1_000_000) * model_costs["input"]
    daily_output_cost = (daily_requests * avg_output_tokens / 1_000_000) * model_costs["output"]
    
    return (daily_input_cost + daily_output_cost) * 30  # monthly
```

## Example: Building Your First GenAI App

Here's how the building blocks come together in 10xGraph:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

```python
# Install AgentFlow
pip install 10xscale-agentflow

# Import the core components
from agentflow.core.graph import StateGraph, Agent
from agentflow.core.state import AgentState, Message
from agentflow.utils import START, END
```

`AgentState` lives in `agentflow.core.state`; the graph classes live in `agentflow.core.graph`.

### Step 2: Define Your Model

There is no model wrapper class to instantiate. `Agent` takes the model identifier as a string and infers the provider from it. Extra keyword arguments are forwarded to the provider SDK.

```python
agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    system_prompt=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful coding assistant."}],
    temperature=0.7,  # 0 = deterministic, 1 = creative
)
```

### Step 3: Create the Agent Graph

`Agent` is itself a node: add it to the graph and wire the edges. It handles the LLM call, so you do not write the request by hand.

```python
from agentflow.core.graph import StateGraph

# Create a state graph — defaults to AgentState
builder = StateGraph()

builder.add_node("chat", agent)
builder.add_edge(START, "chat")   # START edge sets the entry point
builder.add_edge("chat", END)

# Compile the graph
app = builder.compile()
```

### Step 4: Run the App

```python
# Invoke the agent — input is a dict with a "messages" list
result = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [Message.text_message("Hello! What is AgentFlow?")]},
    config={"thread_id": "session-1"},
)

# Get the response
print(result["messages"][-1].text())
```

`Message.text_message()` builds a user message by default. `Message.text()` pulls the plain text back out of the content blocks.

### Step 5: Add Streaming (Better UX)

```python
from agentflow.core.state import StreamEvent

# Stream responses for better perceived latency
for chunk in app.stream({"messages": [Message.text_message("Hello!")]}):
    if chunk.event == StreamEvent.MESSAGE and chunk.message:
        print(chunk.message.text(), end="", flush=True)

print()  # newline at the end
```

### Complete Code

```python
from agentflow.core.graph import StateGraph, Agent
from agentflow.core.state import Message
from agentflow.utils import START, END

# Initialize the agent node
agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    system_prompt=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful coding assistant."}],
)

# Create graph
builder = StateGraph()
builder.add_node("chat", agent)
builder.add_edge(START, "chat")
builder.add_edge("chat", END)

app = builder.compile()

# Run
result = app.invoke({
    "messages": [Message.text_message("Hello!")]
})
print(result["messages"][-1].text())
```

## Exercise: Classify Product Ideas

For each product idea, decide:

1. **No LLM** — Traditional software
2. **LLM App** — Single prompt + structured output
3. **Workflow** — Sequential steps with LLM
4. **Agent** — Dynamic tool use and decisions

### Product Ideas

| # | Idea | Classification | Reasoning |
|---|------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | Email spam classifier | | |
| 2 | Research paper summarizer | | |
| 3 | Automated customer support chatbot | | |
| 4 | Code review assistant | | |
| 5 | Daily news digest generator | | |
| 6 | Trading bot with live data | | |
| 7 | Meeting notes action extractor | | |
| 8 | Form auto-filler | | |
| 9 | Customer sentiment analyzer | | |
| 10 | Personal calendar scheduler | | |

### Answer Key

| # | Classification | Reasoning |
|---|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | No LLM | Binary classification, can use traditional ML |
| 2 | LLM App | Summarization is a core LLM capability |
| 3 | Agent | Needs tools (KB, orders), dynamic responses |
| 4 | LLM App or Agent | Depends on complexity |
| 5 | LLM App | Summarization + formatting |
| 6 | Agent | Dynamic tool use (APIs), decision-making |
| 7 | LLM App | Extraction from text |
| 8 | No LLM | Form filling is deterministic |
| 9 | LLM App | Classification task |
| 10 | Workflow or Agent | Depends on complexity |

## What You Learned

1. **Problem fit matters** — Not every problem needs an LLM or agent
2. **GenAI apps have 5 building blocks** — Model, instructions, tools, state, output
3. **Model selection is a tradeoff** — Quality vs. speed vs. cost vs. capabilities
4. **10xGraph provides StateGraph** — Simple way to compose GenAI applications
5. **Start simple** — Add complexity only when needed

---

## Common Failure Mode

**Starting with an agent when a workflow would work**

Teams often over-engineer by jumping straight to multi-agent systems. Before reaching for agents, ask:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Questions["Before Using Agents"]
        Q1["Can this be a simple LLM app?"]
        Q2["Does it really need dynamic tool selection?"]
        Q3["Would sequential steps work?"]
        Q4["Do I need multiple agents for different expertise?"]
    end
    
    Q1 & Q2 & Q3 --> |"No to all"| Simple["Use simpler approach"]
    
    style Simple fill:#ccffcc
```

Agents add complexity. Make sure you need that complexity.
