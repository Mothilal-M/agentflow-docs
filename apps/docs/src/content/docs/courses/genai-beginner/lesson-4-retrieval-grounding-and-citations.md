- Ground responses in specific knowledge sources
- Add citations to agent outputs
- Identify when retrieval is and isn't needed

## Concept: Why Retrieval?

LLMs have two fundamental limitations:

1. **Knowledge cutoff** — They don't know about recent events or private data
2. **Hallucination** — They can generate plausible but incorrect information

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph LLM["LLM Alone"]
        Q["Question"] --> L["LLM"]
        L --> A["Answer (may hallucinate)"]
    end
    
    subgraph RAG["With Retrieval"]
        Q2["Question"] --> R["Retrieve\nRelevant Docs"]
        R --> G["LLM"]
        G --> A2["Grounded\nAnswer"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#ffcccc
    style A2 fill:#ccffcc
```

### When Retrieval Helps

| Situation | Retrieval? | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Answering questions about your company | ✅ Yes | Private knowledge |
| Recent news or events | ✅ Yes | Knowledge cutoff |
| Technical documentation | ✅ Yes | Precise facts needed |
| General knowledge ("What is Python?") | ❌ No | LLM already knows |
| Creative writing | ❌ No | No factual grounding needed |

## Concept: The 2-Step RAG Pattern

The classic RAG pattern has two steps:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Indexing["1. Indexing (One-time)"]
        Docs["Documents"] --> Chunk["Chunk\n(500 tokens)"]
        Chunk --> Embed["Embed\nChunk"]
        Embed --> Store["Vector\nStore"]
    end
    
    subgraph Query["2. Query (Per request)"]
        Q["User Query"] --> QEmbed["Embed Query"]
        QEmbed --> Search["Search\nVector Store"]
        Search --> TopK["Top-K\nChunks"]
        TopK --> Prompt["Build\nPrompt"]
        Prompt --> LLM["LLM"]
        LLM --> Answer["Grounded\nAnswer"]
    end
    
    Store -.-> |"at query time"| Search
```

### Retrieval vs. Context Window

Retrieval is often better than stuffing everything into context:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Long context** | Simpler implementation | Higher cost, quality degrades |
| **Retrieval** | Targeted, cheaper | Additional complexity |
| **Hybrid** | Best of both | Most complex |

## Concept: Grounding and Citations

Grounding means ensuring answers come from specific sources. Citations make this verifiable.

### Grounding Prompt Pattern

```python
grounding_prompt = """
Answer the question using ONLY the provided context.
If the answer is not in the context, say "I don't know based on the provided information."

Context:
---
{retrieved_chunks}
---

Question: {user_question}

Answer with citations: [Source: filename]
"""
```

### Citation Format

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Answer["Grounded Answer"]
        Text["The system was deployed on March 15, 2024."]
        Source["[Source: deployment-guide.md]"]
    end
    
    Text --> Combined
    Source --> Combined
```

### Citation Schema

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class GroundedAnswer(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    sources: list[str]
    confidence: float
    
    # Optional: specific citations with quotes
    citations: Optional[list[dict]] = None
```

---

## Concept: Retrieval Failure Modes

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Irrelevant chunks** | Poor embeddings | Use better model, add filters |
| **Missed relevant docs** | Low recall | Hybrid search, lower threshold |
| **Stale data** | Outdated index | Refresh index periodically |
| **Prompt injection** | Malicious docs | Sanitize retrieved content |

### Prompt Injection Risk

⚠️ **Never trust retrieved content without sanitization**

```python
# ❌ Dangerous: Retained doc content in prompt
prompt = f"""
Answer based on this document:

{doc_content}  # Could contain injected instructions!
"""

# ✅ Safer: Citation only, not raw content
prompt = f"""
Answer based on documents with IDs: {doc_ids}
Cite the source in your response.
"""
```

---

## Example: Building a Q&A System with RAG

### Step 1: Define the Schema

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Document(BaseModel):
    content: str
    source: str
    chunk_id: str

class QAResponse(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    sources: list[str]
    confidence: float
```

### Step 2: Index Documents

The store owns the embedding model, so indexing means handing it text plus metadata. It embeds and writes the vector for you.

```python
from agentflow.storage.store import QdrantStore
from agentflow.storage.store.embedding import OpenAIEmbedding
from agentflow.storage.store.store_schema import MemoryType

vector_store = QdrantStore(
    embedding=OpenAIEmbedding(model="text-embedding-3-small"),
    collection_name="knowledge_base",
    path="./qdrant_data",
)

config = {"user_id": "docs-index"}

async def index_documents(documents: list[Document]):
    await vector_store.asetup()
    for doc in documents:
        await vector_store.astore(
            config=config,
            content=doc.content,
            memory_type=MemoryType.SEMANTIC,
            metadata={"source": doc.source, "chunk_id": doc.chunk_id},
        )
```

### Step 3: Retrieve and Answer

`asearch()` embeds the query with the same model and returns `MemorySearchResult` objects carrying `content`, `score`, and the `metadata` you indexed.

```python
import json

from agentflow.core.llm import call_llm

async def rag_query(question: str, top_k: int = 5) -> QAResponse:
    # 1. Retrieve relevant chunks (the query is embedded for you)
    results = await vector_store.asearch(
        config=config,
        query=question,
        limit=top_k,
    )

    # 2. Build context
    context = "\n\n".join(
        f"[Source: {r.metadata['source']}]\n{r.content}" for r in results
    )

    # 3. Generate answer with grounding
    prompt = f"""
    Answer the question using the provided sources.
    Cite each statement with [Source: filename].
    Reply as JSON matching: {QAResponse.model_json_schema()}

    Sources:
    {context}

    Question: {question}
    """

    text, *_ = await call_llm("gpt-4o", prompt, json_mode=True)
    return QAResponse(**json.loads(text))
```

`call_llm` returns the tuple `(text, input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_read_tokens)`, so the answer text is the first element. Inside a graph you would use an `Agent` node with `output_schema=QAResponse` instead, and let the framework parse the structured output.

### Step 4: Run the System

```python
# Index some documents
documents = [
    Document(content="AgentFlow was founded in 2024...", source="about.md", chunk_id="1"),
    Document(content="To install AgentFlow: pip install...", source="install.md", chunk_id="2"),
]

await index_documents(documents)

# Query
result = await rag_query("When was AgentFlow founded?")
print(result.answer)
# "AgentFlow was founded in 2024. [Source: about.md]"
```

---

## Exercise: Add Citations to an Existing Agent

### Your Task

Take a simple Q&A agent and add:

1. **Citation support** — Every factual statement includes a source
2. **"Don't know" handling** — When retrieval returns nothing relevant
3. **Confidence scoring** — Rate answer confidence based on retrieval quality

### Template

```python
class CitationAwareAgent:
    def __init__(self, vector_store, llm):
        self.store = vector_store
        self.llm = llm
    
    def query(self, question: str) -> dict:
        # 1. Retrieve relevant documents
        # 2. Check if retrieval is sufficient
        # 3. Generate answer with citations
        # 4. Calculate confidence
        pass
```

### Test Cases

| Question | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| "When was 10xGraph founded?" | Answer with source citation |
| "What is the meaning of life?" | "I don't have information about this" |
| "Tell me about [undocumented topic]" | "I don't have information about this" |

---

## What You Learned

1. **Retrieval grounds knowledge** — Use it when LLM knowledge is insufficient
2. **Citations build trust** — Always cite sources for factual claims
3. **Retrieval can fail** — Have fallback for when retrieval returns nothing
4. **Watch for injection** — Never blindly trust retrieved content

---

## Common Failure Mode

**Retrieval without citation**

Retrieving context but not citing sources:

```python
# ❌ No citation
prompt = f"Answer based on: {retrieved_context}"

# ✅ With citation
prompt = f"""
Answer based on [Source: {source}].
{retrieved_context}
Cite sources in your response.
"""
```
