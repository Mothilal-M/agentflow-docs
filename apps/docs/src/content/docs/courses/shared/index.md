These pages cover concepts that both the Beginner and Advanced courses rely on. They provide just enough theory to understand system behavior without becoming a separate ML course.

## Why These Topics Are Shared

Both courses need a common vocabulary for:

- **Tokenization and context windows** — to reason about prompt size and cost
- **Embeddings and similarity** — to understand retrieval
- **Transformers and attention** — to understand why context design matters
- **Prompt patterns** — to build reliable outputs

## How to Use These Pages

### For the Beginner Course

Read these pages **before** or **alongside** the lessons:

1. [LLM basics for engineers](/docs/courses/shared/llm-basics-for-engineers) → Before Lesson 1
2. [Tokenization and context windows](/docs/courses/shared/tokenization-and-context-windows) → Before Lesson 2
3. [Embeddings and similarity](/docs/courses/shared/embeddings-vectorization-and-similarity) → Before Lesson 4
4. [Prompt and output patterns cheatsheet](/docs/courses/shared/prompt-and-output-patterns-cheatsheet) → Reference throughout

### For the Advanced Course

These pages serve as a **refresher and common vocabulary**:

- [Context engineering recap](/docs/courses/shared/tokenization-and-context-windows) → Lesson 3
- [Retrieval architecture](/docs/courses/shared/chunking-and-retrieval-primitives) → Lesson 4
- [Design checklists](/docs/courses/shared/design-checklists) → Reference for architecture decisions
- [Glossary](/docs/courses/shared/glossary) → For consistent terminology

## Key Principles

### 1. Enough Theory, Not Too Much

These pages teach concepts needed for building, not for publishing papers. We skip:

- ❌ Matrix derivations and math
- ❌ Full training pipeline details
- ❌ Exhaustive benchmark comparisons

We focus on:

- ✅ Mental models that predict system behavior
- ✅ Engineering decisions and tradeoffs
- ✅ Practical patterns that work

### 2. Theory → Practice → Theory

Each page includes:

1. Conceptual explanation with diagrams
2. Practical code examples
3. Design implications

### 3. Consistent Terminology

Both courses use these terms consistently. If you see a term you don't recognize, check the [Glossary](/docs/courses/shared/glossary).
