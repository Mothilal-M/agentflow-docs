## A

### Agent

A system that uses an LLM to decide which actions to take, can use tools, maintains state across calls, and can operate with varying levels of autonomy.

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 1: Use cases, models, and the LLM app lifecycle](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-1-use-cases-models-and-app-lifecycle)

### Agentic RAG

A retrieval-augmented generation pattern where the agent decides what to retrieve, when to retrieve, and whether to retrieve again. Contrast with 2-step RAG where retrieval happens once before generation.

**Related:** [Advanced Lesson 4: Knowledge systems and advanced RAG](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-4-knowledge-systems-and-advanced-rag)

### Attention

A mechanism in transformer models that allows each token to attend to all other tokens in the sequence, enabling the model to understand relationships and context.

**Related:** [Shared: Transformer basics](/docs/courses/shared/transformer-basics)

---

## B

### Bounded Autonomy

Designing agent behavior so that it operates within explicit limits (step budgets, tool restrictions, approval gates) rather than running unbounded until completion.

**Related:** [Advanced Lesson 2: Single-agent runtime and bounded autonomy](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-2-single-agent-runtime-and-bounded-autonomy)

### BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)

A common tokenization algorithm that splits text into subword units based on frequency. Most modern LLMs use BPE or similar algorithms.

**Related:** [Shared: Tokenization and context windows](/docs/courses/shared/tokenization-and-context-windows)

---

## C

### Checkpoint

A snapshot of agent state that enables resuming execution after interruption. Checkpoints store the full conversation history and any intermediate variables.

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 5: State, memory, threads, and streaming](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-5-state-memory-threads-and-streaming)

### Chunk

A segment of a document created during the ingestion process. Chunk size and overlap affect retrieval quality.

**Related:** [Shared: Chunking and retrieval primitives](/docs/courses/shared/chunking-and-retrieval-primitives)

### Citation

A reference to the source document or passage used to ground an LLM's response. Citations increase trust and enable fact-checking.

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 4: Retrieval, grounding, and citations](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-4-retrieval-grounding-and-citations)

### Context Window

The maximum number of tokens (input + output) that an LLM can process in a single request. Context window size limits how much information you can pass to the model.

**Related:** [Shared: Tokenization and context windows](/docs/courses/shared/tokenization-and-context-windows)

### Cosine Similarity

A measure of similarity between two vectors, ranging from -1 to 1. In retrieval, documents with high cosine similarity to a query are considered relevant.

**Related:** [Shared: Embeddings and similarity](/docs/courses/shared/embeddings-vectorization-and-similarity)

---

## D

### Deterministic Workflow

A predefined sequence of steps with no LLM decision-making. Contrast with agentic systems where the model chooses actions.

**Related:** [Advanced Lesson 1: Agentic product fit and system boundaries](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-1-agentic-product-fit-and-system-bounded-autonomy)

### Durable Execution

An execution model where long-running tasks survive server restarts and can be resumed from the last checkpoint.

**Related:** [Advanced Lesson 7: Memory, checkpoints, artifacts, and durable execution](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-7-memory-checkpoints-artifacts-and-durable-execution)

---

## E

### Embedding

A numerical representation of text (or other data) as a vector of numbers. Semantically similar texts have embeddings that are close in vector space.

**Related:** [Shared: Embeddings and similarity](/docs/courses/shared/embeddings-vectorization-and-similarity)

### Eval (Evaluation)

A systematic test of LLM output quality. Evals can be golden dataset comparisons, regression tests, or human ratings.

---

## F

### Fan-out / Fan-in

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 4: Retrieval, grounding, and citations](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-4-retrieval-grounding-and-citations)

---

## H

### Handoff

The transfer of control or context between agents. Handoffs can be peer-to-peer (equal agents transfer conversation) or hierarchical (manager delegates to specialist).

**Related:** [Advanced Lesson 6: Handoffs, human review, and control surfaces](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-6-handoffs-human-review-and-control-surfaces)

### Human-in-the-loop

**Related:** [Advanced Lesson 6: Handoffs, human review, and control surfaces](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-6-handoffs-human-review-and-control-surfaces)

### Hybrid RAG

A retrieval strategy that combines vector similarity search with keyword/exact-match search for better coverage.

**Related:** [Advanced Lesson 4: Knowledge systems and advanced RAG](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-4-knowledge-systems-and-advanced-rag)

---

## I

### Instruction Hierarchy

The precedence order for different instruction types. System instructions typically take priority over user instructions, which take priority over examples.

**Related:** [Shared: Prompt and output patterns cheatsheet](/docs/courses/shared/prompt-and-output-patterns-cheatsheet)

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 3: Tools, files, and MCP basics](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-3-tools-files-and-mcp-basics)

### Memory

Storage of conversation context or learned information. In 10xGraph, memory can be short-term (thread state) or long-term (persistent store).

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 5: State, memory, threads, and streaming](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-5-state-memory-threads-and-streaming)

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 6: Multimodal and client/server integration](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-6-multimodal-and-client-server-integration)

---

## N

### Next-token Prediction

The core task LLMs are trained on: predicting the most likely next token given all previous tokens. This probabilistic nature is why outputs vary.

**Related:** [Shared: LLM basics for engineers](/docs/courses/shared/llm-basics-for-engineers)

---

## P

### Positional Encoding

A mechanism that gives transformer models information about token positions. Without it, attention would be position-agnostic.

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 7: Evals, safety, cost, and release](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-7-evals-safety-cost-and-release)

### Prompt Template

A parameterized prompt structure where variables are replaced at runtime. Templates enable reusable prompt engineering.

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 2: Prompting, context engineering, and structured outputs](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-2-prompting-context-and-structured-outputs)

---

## R

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

A pattern where an LLM retrieves relevant documents before generating a response. RAG helps ground outputs in specific knowledge.

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 4: Retrieval, grounding, and citations](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-4-retrieval-grounding-and-citations), [Advanced Lesson 4: Knowledge systems and advanced RAG](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-4-knowledge-systems-and-advanced-rag)

A persistent conversation context identified by a unique ID. Threads enable conversation continuity and state restoration.

**Related:** [Beginner Lesson 5: State, memory, threads, and streaming](/docs/courses/genai-beginner/lesson-5-state-memory-threads-and-streaming)

### Token

The basic unit of text processed by an LLM. Tokens are not exactly words—a token is typically a few characters or a fraction of a word.

**Related:** [Shared: Tokenization and context windows](/docs/courses/shared/tokenization-and-context-windows)
