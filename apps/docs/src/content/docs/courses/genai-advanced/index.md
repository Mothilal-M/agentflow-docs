Design reliable architecture choices for agent systems in production. This course is for engineers who understand the basics and need to make architectural decisions.

## What You'll Learn

| Lesson | Topic | Key Decision |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [Agentic product fit and system boundaries](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-1-agentic-product-fit-and-system-bounded-autonomy) | When to use agents vs. workflows |
| 2 | [Single-agent runtime and bounded autonomy](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-2-single-agent-runtime-and-bounded-autonomy) | Limits and recovery patterns |
| 3 | [Context engineering, long context, and caching](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-3-context-engineering-long-context-and-caching) | Optimize context for quality and cost |
| 4 | [Knowledge systems and advanced RAG](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-4-knowledge-systems-and-advanced-rag) | Choose retrieval architectures |
| 5 | [Router, manager, and specialist patterns](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-5-router-manager-and-specialist-patterns) | Multi-agent orchestration |
| 6 | [Handoffs, human review, and control surfaces](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-6-handoffs-human-review-and-control-surfaces) | Human-in-the-loop design |
| 7 | [Memory, checkpoints, artifacts, and durable execution](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-7-memory-checkpoints-artifacts-and-durable-execution) | Runtime durability |
| 8 | [Observability, testing, security, and deployment](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-8-observability-testing-security-and-deployment) | Production readiness |

```

## Prerequisites

- Completed the [GenAI Beginner Course](/docs/courses/genai-beginner) (or equivalent)
- Comfortable with 10xGraph core concepts
- Building or maintaining GenAI applications

## Time Commitment

| Component | Time |
|-----------|------|
| 8 lessons | 45-75 min each |
| Architecture exercise | 1-2 hours |
| **Total** | ~8-10 hours |

## How Each Lesson Is Structured

Each advanced lesson follows this structure:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Lesson["Advanced Lesson Structure"]
        Theory["1. Theory\nArchitecture concepts and tradeoffs"]
        Patterns["2. Patterns\nWhen to use, when not to"]
        Implementation["3. Implementation\nAgentFlow code patterns"]
        Exercise["4. Exercise\nArchitecture decision exercise"]
    end
```

1. **Theory** — Architectural concepts with tradeoffs
2. **Patterns** — When to use, when NOT to use
3. **Implementation** — 10xGraph code patterns
4. **Exercise** — Apply concepts to a real scenario

## Key Differences from Beginner

| Aspect | Beginner | Advanced |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Focus** | Building one feature | Choosing between patterns |
| **Questions** | "How do I...?" | "Should I...?" and "Which is better?" |
| **Failure modes** | Implementation bugs | Architectural mistakes |
| **Tradeoffs** | Basic (speed vs. quality) | Complex (context, cost, latency, safety) |

## Your Learning Path

### Start With Shared Foundations

If you need a refresher:

- [LLM basics](/docs/courses/shared/llm-basics-for-engineers)
- [Tokenization](/docs/courses/shared/tokenization-and-context-windows)
- [Embeddings](/docs/courses/shared/embeddings-vectorization-and-similarity)
- [Design checklists](/docs/courses/shared/design-checklists)

### Then Continue With Lessons

Start with [Lesson 1: Agentic product fit and system boundaries](/docs/courses/genai-advanced/lesson-1-agentic-product-fit-and-system-bounded-autonomy)

## After This Course

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- **Choose architectures** — Workflow vs. agent vs. multi-agent
- **Design bounded systems** — Limits, recovery, and failure containment
- **Optimize context** — Context engineering, caching, and compaction
- **Build multi-agent systems** — Routing, delegation, and handoffs
- **Implement human-in-the-loop** — Approval flows and interrupts
- **Ship production-ready** — Testing, observability, and security

If you've completed the beginner course, this advanced course goes deeper into the architectural decisions behind what you built.
