`agentflow.json` is the single source of truth for how your API server behaves. This guide walks through each field with examples and explains when to use each option. For a complete reference, see [agentflow.json Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/api-cli/configuration).

## Basic structure

Every `agentflow.json` must have at least an `agent` field:

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app"
}
```

This tells the server where to load your compiled graph from. All other fields are optional but recommended for production.

## Core fields

### agent (required)

The import path to your compiled graph, in the format `module:attribute`:

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app"
}
```

This import happens when the server starts. The module `graph.react` is imported and the `app` attribute is retrieved. The `app` must be a `CompiledGraph` instance:

```python
# graph/react.py
from agentflow.core.graph import StateGraph

state_graph = StateGraph(MyState)
# ... add nodes, edges ...
app = state_graph.compile()  # app is the compiled graph
```

**Why it matters:** If this import fails, the server will not start. Common issues:
- The module does not exist (typo in the path)
- The attribute does not exist on the module
- The module has syntax errors

**Debugging:** Test the import manually:

```bash
python -c "from graph.react import app; print(type(app))"
```

### env (optional)

Path to a `.env` file containing environment variables:

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "env": ".env"
}
```

The server uses `python-dotenv` to load this file before importing your graph module. This is useful for:

- **Development secrets** (API keys, database URLs) that should not be committed to git
- **Local overrides** of production variables for testing

Example `.env`:

```bash
# API keys
GOOGLE_API_KEY=sk-abc123...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-def456...

# Database connections
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mydb

# Feature flags
ENABLE_STREAMING=true
```

Your graph code accesses them:

```python
import os

api_key = os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"]
```

**Important:** Never commit `.env` files to version control. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.

**In production:** Pass environment variables via container/process environment, not `.env` files:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
export REDIS_URL=...
agentflow api --no-reload
```

## Persistence: Checkpointer

### Without a checkpointer

If you do not pass one, `compile()` falls back to an `InMemoryCheckpointer`. Threads work while
the process runs, but every conversation is lost on restart and is not shared across workers.

### With a checkpointer

Conversation state is saved after each step. By providing a `thread_id`, you can resume a conversation later:

```bash
# First request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/graph/invoke \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is my name?"}],
    "config": {"thread_id": "user-123"}
  }'

# Second request (same thread, context is preserved)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/graph/invoke \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Remind me what I just asked."}],
    "config": {"thread_id": "user-123"}
  }'
```

### Adding a checkpointer

Pass the checkpointer to `compile()` in your graph module. The server uses whatever the compiled
graph named in `agent` carries. Do not rely on the `checkpointer` key in `agentflow.json`: it is
recognised, but the API server does not apply it yet, so setting it has no effect (see
[`checkpointer`](/docs/reference/api-cli/configuration#checkpointer)).

**Development (in-memory, lost on restart):**

```python
# graph/dependencies.py
from agentflow.storage.checkpointer import InMemoryCheckpointer

my_checkpointer = InMemoryCheckpointer()
```

```python
# graph/react.py
from graph.dependencies import my_checkpointer

app = state_graph.compile(checkpointer=my_checkpointer)
```

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app"
}
```

Fast and easy, but state is lost when the server restarts.

**Production (PostgreSQL + Redis):**

Install the optional dependency:

```bash
pip install 10xscale-agentflow[pg_checkpoint]
```

Create the checkpointer:

```python
# graph/dependencies.py
from agentflow.storage.checkpointer import PgCheckpointer

my_checkpointer = PgCheckpointer(
    postgres_dsn="postgresql://user:password@localhost/agentflow",
    redis_url="redis://localhost:6379/0",
)
```

Then compile the graph with it, exactly as above:

```python
# graph/react.py
from graph.dependencies import my_checkpointer

app = state_graph.compile(checkpointer=my_checkpointer)
```

This persists all state to a PostgreSQL database, enabling:
- Durable conversation history across server restarts
- Multi-server deployments (shared state)
- Data retention and compliance

**Health check:** Verify the checkpointer is accessible:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/v1/threads
```

If the database is unreachable, you get a 500 error.

## Thread name generation

When a new conversation thread is created, generate a human-readable name instead of a raw UUID:

```python
# graph/thread_name_generator.py
from agentflow_cli.src.app.utils.thread_name_generator import ThreadNameGenerator

class MyThreadNameGenerator(ThreadNameGenerator):
    async def generate_name(self, messages: list[str]) -> str:
        # Optionally use message context or an LLM
        return "thoughtful-conversation"

my_generator = MyThreadNameGenerator()
```

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "thread_name_generator": "graph.thread_name_generator:MyThreadNameGenerator"
}
```

When a new thread is created via the API, it automatically gets a readable name like `exploring-ideas` instead of `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`.

## Memory store

The `store` field points at a `BaseStore` instance. Without it the `/v1/store/*` endpoints report
that no store is configured, even if your graph uses one internally.

```python
# graph/dependencies.py
from agentflow.storage.store import QdrantStore
from agentflow.storage.store.embedding import OpenAIEmbedding

my_store = QdrantStore(
    embedding=OpenAIEmbedding(),
    path="./qdrant_data",
)
```

For local development and tests, `agentflow.qa.testing.InMemoryStore` is a `BaseStore`
implementation with no external dependencies — it satisfies the same field:

```python
from agentflow.qa.testing import InMemoryStore

my_store = InMemoryStore()
```

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "store": "graph.dependencies:my_store"
}
```

The value is a `module:attribute` path resolving to an instance, not a class. Loading fails at
startup with a clear error if the attribute is not a `BaseStore`.

## Dependency injection

The `injectq` field points at an `InjectQ` container. Use it when your nodes or tools need
services resolved at startup: a database session factory, an HTTP client, a settings object.

```python
# graph/dependencies.py
from injectq import InjectQ

container = InjectQ()
container.bind_instance(MyDatabase, MyDatabase(dsn=os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]))
```

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "injectq": "graph.dependencies:container"
}
```

The container is activated as the global instance when it loads, so the server's own bindings
(graph config, auth backend, media service, checkpointer) land in the same container as yours.
Bind a `BaseRateLimitBackend` here when using `"backend": "custom"` for rate limiting.

## Redis

A single Redis URL for the server's own use, as a plain string:

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "redis": "redis://localhost:6379/0"
}
```

It backs the shared L2 tier of the thread-ownership cache used by the `ownership` and `rbac`
authorization backends. When it is unset the server falls back to the `REDIS_URL` environment
variable. With neither set, or without the `redis` package installed, the cache runs in-process
only and the server logs a warning; nothing breaks, but each worker pays its own first lookup per
thread.

This is separate from `rate_limit.redis`, which the rate limiter uses. Configure both if you want
both features backed by Redis:

```json
{
  "redis": "redis://localhost:6379/0",
  "rate_limit": {
    "backend": "redis",
    "redis": { "url": "redis://localhost:6379/1" }
  }
}
```

## Rate limiting

Add a `rate_limit` block to turn on the sliding-window limiter. It is off until you do.

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "rate_limit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "backend": "memory",
    "requests": 100,
    "window": 60,
    "by": "ip",
    "trusted_proxy_headers": false,
    "trusted_proxy_hops": 1,
    "exclude_paths": ["/ping", "/docs", "/redoc", "/openapi.json"],
    "fail_open": true
  }
}
```

Three things that are easy to miss:

- `by` accepts `"user"` as well as `"ip"` and `"global"`. Switch to `"user"` once auth is enabled.
- The limiter also gates **WebSocket handshakes** on `/v1/graph/ws` and `/v1/graph/live`, sharing
  the same bucket as REST. Exceeding it closes the handshake with code `1013`.
- `"backend": "memory"` counts per process and logs a startup warning. With N workers the real
  limit is `requests x N`.

Full reference: [Rate Limiting](/docs/reference/api-cli/rate-limiting). Step-by-step setup:
[Configure rate limiting](/docs/how-to/api-cli/configure-rate-limiting).

## WebSocket settings

Cap how many WebSocket connections a single server process will hold open:

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "websocket": {
    "max_connections": 100,
    "max_connections_per_user": 5
  }
}
```

`max_connections` counts `/v1/graph/ws` and `/v1/graph/live` together. `max_connections_per_user`
caps how many of those one verified user may hold. A missing field keeps its default (`1000` and
`10`); only an explicit `0` or `null` removes a cap. A negative value raises a `ValueError`.

Both WebSocket endpoints are always mounted. There is no switch to turn `/v1/graph/ws` off; clients
that only need REST can use `POST /v1/graph/stream` (SSE) and simply never open the socket.

To let `/v1/graph/live` clients pick their realtime model, list the allowed ones in
`realtime_models`. Any other requested model is ignored and the agent's own model is used:

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "websocket": {
    "realtime_models": ["gemini-2.5-flash-live"]
  }
}
```

The block is read when a connection opens rather than at startup, so a bad value shows up on the
first handshake. `agentflow config` validates it ahead of time.

When a cap is reached the handshake is refused before `accept()` with close code `1013`, so the
client sees a clean rejection rather than a socket that opens and immediately dies. The slot is
released when the handler returns or the client disconnects.

The counter is per process, like the in-memory rate-limit backend. With four workers,
`max_connections: 100` means up to 400 concurrent sockets across the deployment. Size it per
worker, not per cluster.

## Observability

Send graph, node, LLM, and tool spans to [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) and/or [LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/) by adding an `observability` block. The server configures the exporters and attaches the tracing publisher at startup — you do not call any setup helper yourself.

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "observability": {
    "level": "standard",
    "logfire":   { "enabled": true, "service_name": "my-agent", "send_to_logfire": true, "console": false },
    "langsmith": { "enabled": true, "project": "my-agent", "endpoint": null }
  }
}
```

Keep the secrets in `.env`, never in `agentflow.json`:

```bash
LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your-logfire-write-token
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-langsmith-api-key
```

Field notes:

- `level` — `spans` (timing only), `standard` (default; token counts, model, params — no message content), or `full` (adds prompt/completion content; PII risk, opt in deliberately).
- `logfire.enabled` / `langsmith.enabled` — turn each backend on independently; enable both to fan out to both.
- `langsmith.endpoint` — leave `null` for the default, or set a regional base URL like `https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com/otel`.
- Requires the extra: `pip install '10xscale-agentflow[observability]'`. If a backend is enabled but its package or key is missing, the server logs a warning and starts without that exporter.

For the equivalent Python API (`setup_logfire` / `setup_langsmith` / `setup_observability` and the dedicated publishers), see [Send traces to Logfire and LangSmith](/docs/how-to/python/send-traces-to-logfire-langsmith).

## Authentication

### No authentication (development only)

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "auth": null
}
```

Or omit the `auth` field entirely. All requests are accepted.

### JWT authentication

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "auth": "jwt"
}
```

Add required environment variables:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-long-random-secret-key-at-least-32-chars"
export JWT_ALGORITHM="HS256"
agentflow api
```

Clients must now provide a valid JWT token in every request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8000/v1/graph/invoke
```

Requests without a valid token get a `401 Unauthorized` response.

### Custom authentication

For integration with external identity providers (OAuth, SAML, custom API keys):

`authenticate` is **synchronous** and takes `(request, response, credential)` — the bearer token
arrives as `credential`. Do not declare it `async def` (the server calls it without `await`).

```python
# graph/auth.py
from typing import Any

from fastapi import Request, Response
from fastapi.security import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials

from agentflow_cli import BaseAuth

class MyCustomAuth(BaseAuth):
    def authenticate(
        self, request: Request, response: Response,
        credential: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials | None,
    ) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        # Custom header (API key) — or use `credential.credentials` for a bearer token.
        api_key = request.headers.get("X-API-Key")
        if not api_key:
            return None

        user = verify_api_key(api_key)
        if not user:
            return None

        # Return user info (at least user_id) for authorization later.
        return {"user_id": user.id, "role": user.role}
```

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "auth": {
    "method": "custom",
    "path": "graph.auth:MyCustomAuth"
  }
}
```

### Authorization (fine-grained permissions)

After authenticating, restrict which users can access which endpoints. Without an
`authorization` key the default is mode-based — `"ownership"` (owner-only threads) in
production, `"allow_all"` in development. For roles → permissions with no code, use the RBAC
config block:

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "auth": "jwt",
  "authorization": {
    "backend": "rbac",
    "roles": { "admin": ["*"], "user": ["graph:invoke", "graph:stream", "checkpointer:read"] },
    "default_scopes": [],
    "isolation": "owner"
  }
}
```

For arbitrary rules, subclass `AuthorizationBackend`. `authorize` takes
`(user, resource, action, resource_id=None, **context)`:

```python
# graph/auth.py
from typing import Any

from agentflow_cli.src.app.core.auth.authorization import AuthorizationBackend

class MyAuthorizationBackend(AuthorizationBackend):
    async def authorize(
        self, user: dict[str, Any], resource: str, action: str,
        resource_id: str | None = None, **context: Any,
    ) -> bool:
        role = user.get("role", "guest")
        if resource == "graph" and action == "invoke":
            return role == "admin"
        if resource == "checkpointer" and action == "read":
            return role in ("admin", "user")
        return False
```

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "auth": "jwt",
  "authorization": "graph.auth:MyAuthorizationBackend"
}
```

See the [Authentication reference](/docs/reference/api-cli/auth) for the full scope catalog,
`isolation_scope`/`scopes_for`, and how the isolation policy reaches the storage layer.

## Testing

The optional `"test"` section configures the `agentflow test` command, which is a thin wrapper around pytest.

### Minimal example

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "test": {
    "path": "tests/"
  }
}
```

### Full example with coverage

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "test": {
    "path": "tests/",
    "coverage": true,
    "coverage_threshold": 80
  }
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | null (pytest auto-discovery) | Directory or file to pass to pytest |
| `coverage` | boolean | `false` | Enable `--cov` and generate an HTML coverage report in `htmlcov/` |
| `coverage_threshold` | integer | null | Fail the run if coverage falls below this percentage (`--cov-fail-under`) |

### How fields interact with CLI flags

CLI flags always win. The `agentflow.json` values are fallbacks used when the flag is not provided:

```bash
# Uses path/coverage from agentflow.json
agentflow test

# Overrides path; coverage still comes from agentflow.json
agentflow test --path tests/unit/

# Overrides coverage; path still comes from agentflow.json
agentflow test --coverage
```

## Evaluation

The optional `"evaluation"` section configures the `agentflow eval` command. It controls where eval files are discovered, where reports are written, and the default pass-rate threshold. **It does not control evaluation criteria** — those come from `confeval.py` inside your evals directory.

### Minimal example

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "evaluation": {
    "directory": "evals"
  }
}
```

### Full example

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "evaluation": {
    "directory": "evals",
    "output_dir": "eval_reports",
    "threshold": 0.9,
    "parallel": true,
    "max_concurrency": 8
  }
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `directory` | string | `"evals"` | Directory to scan for eval files (files matching `*_eval.py` or `eval_*.py`) |
| `output_dir` | string | `"eval_reports"` | Directory where HTML and JSON reports are written |
| `threshold` | float | null | Minimum pass rate (0.0–1.0). The command exits with code 1 if the pass rate is below this value |
| `parallel` | boolean | `false` | Run eval cases concurrently instead of sequentially |
| `max_concurrency` | integer | `4` | Maximum number of cases running at the same time (only applies when `parallel` is `true`) |

### How fields interact with CLI flags

CLI flags take priority over `agentflow.json`. JSON values are fallbacks:

```bash
# Uses all settings from agentflow.json
agentflow eval

# Overrides output_dir; other settings still come from agentflow.json
agentflow eval --output-dir ci_reports/

# Overrides threshold; directory still comes from agentflow.json
agentflow eval --threshold 0.95

# Overrides parallel and concurrency
agentflow eval --parallel --max-concurrency 16
```

### Criteria configuration

Evaluation criteria (thresholds per criterion, judge model, match type) are **not** set in `agentflow.json`. They live in `confeval.py` inside your evals directory:

```python
# evals/confeval.py
from agentflow.qa.evaluation import EvalConfig, CriteriaConfig, CriterionConfig

EVAL_CONFIG = EvalConfig(
    criteria=CriteriaConfig(
        tool_name_match=CriterionConfig.tool_name_match(threshold=1.0),
        rouge_match=CriterionConfig.rouge_match(threshold=0.5),
        node_order=CriterionConfig.node_order(threshold=0.8),
    )
)
```

If no `confeval.py` is found, the built-in defaults are used.

## Environment-specific configs

Create separate config files for dev, staging, and production:

```
config/
  dev.json
  staging.json
  prod.json
```

**config/dev.json** (local development, no persistence):

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "env": ".env.dev",
  "auth": null
}
```

**config/staging.json** (pre-production):

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "env": ".env.staging",
  "store": "graph.dependencies:qdrant_store",
  "auth": "jwt"
}
```

**config/prod.json** (production, all features):

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "env": ".env.prod",
  "store": "graph.dependencies:qdrant_store_prod",
  "thread_name_generator": "graph.thread_name_generator:ProductionNameGenerator",
  "auth": "jwt",
  "authorization": "graph.auth:ProductionAuthorizationBackend"
}
```

Start the server with the appropriate config:

```bash
# Development
agentflow api --config config/dev.json

# Production
MODE=production agentflow api --config config/prod.json --no-reload
```

## Validating your config

Before deploying, verify the config is valid:

```bash
python -c "
import json
with open('agentflow.json') as f:
    config = json.load(f)
print('Config is valid JSON')
print(f'Agent path: {config.get(\"agent\")}')
"
```

Then test that the graph can be imported:

```bash
python -c "from graph.react import app; print(f'Graph loaded: {type(app)}')
```

If both succeed, your config is likely valid. Start the server and test an endpoint:

```bash
agentflow api &
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/ping
```

## Common config issues

**"Module not found" error**
- Check the module path is spelled correctly
- Verify the module exists in your project
- Try importing manually: `python -c "from graph.react import app"`

**"Attribute not found" error**
- Verify the attribute name exists on the module
- In the example, `graph.react:app` requires an `app` variable in `graph/react.py`

**"Checkpointer database connection failed"**
- Verify the database URL is correct
- Verify the database is running and accessible
- Test the connection: `psql postgresql://user:pass@localhost/agentflow`

**"JWT_SECRET_KEY not found"**
- Set the environment variable: `export JWT_SECRET_KEY=...`
- Or add it to your `.env` file and point `agentflow.json` to it: `"env": ".env"`
